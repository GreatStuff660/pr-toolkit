#summary Learning framework structure

= Learning Framework =

Interfaces:
== EM-Model ==
Update parameters (CountTable)

== OnlineEM ==
Following the definition from StepWise EM paper from Liang:
Online EM for Unsupervised Models

UpdateStepParameter(CountTable, SentenceDist)
And add a class called OnLineEM Training


== GradientBaseEM ==
Folowing the paper from Painless Unsupervised Learning with Features
GetOptimizationObjective
UpdateModelFromOptimizationObjective()
This is used to pass to the optimization package

==TrainSupervised==
For training the models in a supervised fashion....
This should receive an instance list and return the model trained with that list.
